# ChainAware Behavioral Prediction MCP

## What This Skill Does

The **ChainAware Behavioral Prediction MCP** connects any AI agent to a continuously updated
Web3 behavioral intelligence layer: **14M+ wallet profiles** across **8 blockchains**, built from
**1.3 billion+ predictive data points**. It delivers ten capabilities via a single MCP endpoint:

1. **Fraud Detection** — predict fraudulent wallet behavior before it happens (~98% accuracy on ETH)
2. **Batch Fraud Detection** — async batch job for fraud screening large wallet lists; returns `job_id` + `signature`
3. **Behavioral Analysis** — profile wallet intent, risk tolerance, experience, and next likely actions
4. **Batch Behavioral Analysis** — async batch job for behavioral profiling large wallet lists; returns `job_id` + `signature`
5. **Batch Job Status** — poll the progress of any running batch job
6. **Batch Job Results** — retrieve full per-wallet results from a completed or partial batch job
7. **Rug Pull Detection** — forecast whether a smart contract or liquidity pool will rug pull
8. **Credit Score** — crypto credit/trust score (1–9) combining fraud probability and social graph analysis
9. **Token Rank List** — rank tokens by holder community strength across chains and categories
10. **Token Rank Single** — deep-dive into a single token's community quality and top holders

Unlike forensic blockchain tools that describe the past, this MCP is **predictive** — it tells your
agent what is *about to happen*.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### For wallet fraud screening

1. **Confirm inputs** — wallet address and network. If network is missing, ask.
2. **Call `predictive_fraud`** with the wallet address and network.
3. **Interpret `probabilityFraud`** using the threshold table below.
4. **Scan `forensic_details`** for negative flags (mixer use, sanctioned entities, darknet, etc.).
5. **Report** status, score, and any forensic flags in plain language.

### For behavioral profiling / personalization

1. **Confirm inputs** — wallet address and network.
2. **Call `predictive_behaviour`** with the wallet address and network.
3. **Extract key signals**: `intention.Value` (Prob_Trade/Stake/Bridge/NFT_Buy), `experience.Value`, `categories`, `recommendation`.
4. **Classify the wallet** by dominant category and intent signal.
5. **Generate** personalized recommendations or next-best-action based on the profile.

### For rug pull / contract safety checks

1. **Confirm inputs** — smart contract or LP address and network.
2. **Optionally call `predictive_fraud`** on the *deployer* address first for extra signal.
3. **Call `predictive_rug_pull`** with the contract address.
4. **Interpret `probabilityFraud`** and scan `forensic_details` for liquidity and contract risk flags.
5. **Apply the Deployer Risk Amplifier**: if deployer fraud score ≥ 0.5, escalate overall risk one level.
6. **Report** verdict with supporting forensic evidence.

### For token ranking / discovery

1. **Identify the request** — list of tokens or single token deep-dive?
2. **For lists**: call `token_rank_list` with appropriate `category`, `network`, `sort_by: communityRank`, `sort_order: DESC`.
3. **For single tokens**: call `token_rank_single` with `contract_address` and `network`.
4. **Report** `communityRank`, `normalizedRank`, `totalHolders`, and top holder profiles.

### For batch fraud or behavioural screening (large wallet lists)

1. **Schedule** — call `predictive_fraud_batch` or `predictive_behaviour_batch` with the wallet list and network.
2. **Store** both `job_id` and `signature` from the response — required for all follow-up calls.
3. **Poll** — call `check_job_status` with `job_id` + `signature` until status is `completed` or `partial`.
   - Status `pending` or `processing` → wait and retry.
   - Status `partial` → some wallets failed but results are available for completed items.
4. **Retrieve** — call `get_job_results` with `job_id` + `signature` to fetch the full per-wallet data.
5. **Process** — the `data` array returns the same schema as single-wallet `predictive_behaviour` / `predictive_fraud` results.

> Never call `get_job_results` while status is still `pending` or `processing`. The job `expires_at` timestamp in the status response indicates how long results are retained.

### For full due diligence (multi-tool)

1. Call `predictive_fraud` → get fraud score and forensic flags
2. Call `predictive_behaviour` → get behavioral profile and intent
3. Call `predictive_rug_pull` (if a contract address) → get contract risk
4. Synthesize all three into a unified verdict with risk level and recommendation

> For complex due diligence workflows, escalate to the `chainaware-wallet-auditor` subagent.

## Real-World Use Cases

### DeFi Platforms
- **Risk-adjusted lending** — use fraud scores and behavioral profiles to set collateral requirements and interest rates per borrower
- **Liquidity management** — use intent signals to pre-position reserves and prevent pool drain
- **Yield routing** — identify wallets with high yield-seeking intent and route them to optimal vaults

### AI Agent Personalization
- Give your agent a real-time behavioral profile of each wallet it talks to
- Segment users automatically into DeFi Lender, NFT Trader, Bridge User, New Wallet, etc.

### Fraud & Compliance
- Screen wallets at the point of entry to your Dapp — before any transaction takes place
- Run AML monitoring across all active wallets
- Detect rug pull contracts at launchpad listing stage

### NFT & GameFi
- Personalize in-game economies based on a player wallet's on-chain history
- Filter bot wallets and wash traders from NFT drops using fraud scores

## Tips for Success

1. **Always specify the network** — many tools behave differently across chains
2. **Run fraud check first** — before any behavioral profiling, gate on fraud score
3. **Combine tools for full due diligence** — fraud + behaviour + rug pull together give a complete picture
4. **Use the Deployer Risk Amplifier** — a clean contract from a fraudulent deployer is still high risk
5. **For small lists (< 5 wallets)** — use subagents like `chainaware-fraud-detector` or `chainaware-airdrop-screener` which call single-wallet tools in a loop
6. **For 5+ wallets** — use batch tools directly: `predictive_fraud_batch` or `predictive_behaviour_batch` → `check_job_status` → `get_job_results`
7. **Always store job_id + signature** — both are required for every follow-up batch call; losing either means you cannot retrieve results
8. **Surface forensic flags in plain language** — never return raw JSON to end users

## Data & Privacy

### What data leaves your environment

Every tool call transmits the following to `https://prediction.mcp.chainaware.ai/sse`:

| Field | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `walletAddress` | `0xABC...` | Pseudonymous on-chain identifier — not PII |
| `network` | `ETH` | Chain identifier only |
| `apiKey` | _(your key)_ | Sourced from `CHAINAWARE_API_KEY` env var; never logged |

**What is NOT sent:** names, emails, IP addresses, private keys, raw transaction history, or any off-chain personal data.

### API key handling

`CHAINAWARE_API_KEY` is read from the environment and passed as the `apiKey` parameter in each tool call. It is never included in output, never written to disk, and never logged by this skill. Treat it as a secret and rotate it regularly.

### Integration-specific privacy notes

- **Claude Code / Cursor**: key passed via `X-API-Key` header — does not appear in URLs or logs
- **Claude Web / ChatGPT**: key must be appended to the SSE URL (`?apiKey=...`) — these platforms do not support custom SSE headers. Be aware the key will appear in your browser's network tab. Use a restricted-scope key for these integrations.

### Operator responsibilities

Wallet addresses are pseudonymous identifiers. Whether they constitute personal data in your jurisdiction depends on your regulatory context (e.g. GDPR, MiCA). Operators processing wallets linked to identified users should perform their own data protection assessment.

**Privacy policy:** https://chainaware.ai/privacy

---

## Security Notes

- **Never hard-code API keys** in public repositories
- The server uses **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** for streaming responses
- Rate limits apply depending on your subscription tier

---

## Error Reference

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `403 Unauthorized` | Invalid or missing `apiKey` |
| `400 Bad Request` | Malformed `network` or `walletAddress` |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Temporary backend failure — retry after a short delay |
